### Tech Stack

The tech used was nextJS (NextJS is a framework built on top of React to make server and client side rendering faster)
and tailwind for styling.


### Folder Structure

The folder structure is the normal next js folder structure that comes with its default initilization.

I'm using the pages router. 

### Pages Folder

It has only the index page, since its a single page application. But it uses the components from the components folder.


### Components Folder

Holds the Navbar and Footer components.
